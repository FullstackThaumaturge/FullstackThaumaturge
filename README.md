I'm only here because, as a developer, it might complicate my next job hunt if people can't find me here.

I prefer [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/) for hosting personal projects. You can find my public repositories at [https://git.sr.ht/~starbreaker](https://git.sr.ht/~starbreaker) and [https://git.sr.ht/~demifiend](https://git.sr.ht/~demifiend).
